# The WP Community Collective Community Repositories

This repository serves as the central directory for The WP Community Collective’s public community ecosystem. It hosts topic-based repositories that support collaboration with community groups, contributors, and partner organizations who share The WPCC’s mission and values.

Each topic repository contains one or more affiliated community groups or partners. These efforts are not projects funded by The WPCC, but are supported and coordinated in alignment with The WPCC’s polciies and goals for sustainability, transparency, and open-source contribution.

## Structure

- Each **topic** (e.g., Sustainability, Accessibility, Governance) has its own repository (e.g., `community-sustainability`)
- Each **group or partner** under that topic has a dedicated sub-repository (e.g., `community-sustainability-team`)

---

## Current Topics

- [Sustainability](https://github.com/thewpcommunitycollective/community-sustainability) — Coordination around sustainable contribution practices
